         <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> September 6, 2025</p>

  <p>Please read these Terms of Service ("Terms") carefully before using my website at <a href="https://jacobbradley.co.uk">jacobbradley.co.uk</a> (the "Site"). These Terms apply to all visitors and clients. By accessing or using this Site or my services, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, you may not use my Site or services.</p>

  <h2>1. Services</h2>
  <p>I offer custom website design, website development, hosting, maintenance and updates, domain name registration and management, email setup, and search engine optimisation (SEO).</p>

  <h2>2. Payments and Deposits</h2>
  <p>Full payment for development is due once you approve the final version of the website. Ongoing services such as hosting or maintenance are billed monthly or annually, depending on your chosen package. I currently accept payment via bank transfer or PayPal.</p>

  <h2>3. Refund Policy</h2>
  <p>All deposits are non-refundable. If you cancel the project after accepting the quote but before completion, you will lose the deposit. If you cancel after Iâ€™ve delivered a final version that you approved, no refunds will be given.</p>

  <h2>4. Domain Names</h2>
  <p>I usually register domain names under my own account for easier management. However, you are the legal owner of any domain you pay for. I will transfer ownership to you on request at no extra charge, provided your account is up to date and no payments are overdue.</p>

  <h2>5. Intellectual Property</h2>
  <p>You own all content (text and images) that you provide. I own any original content I create or source unless explicitly transferred to you. Once full payment has been received, you own the completed website, including the code and design. I reserve the right to reuse my code, design elements, and templates in future projects.</p>

  <h2>6. Revisions and Additional Work</h2>
  <p>Revisions are free before the site is published and live. Simple changes such as updating/adding photos, links etc. come under the monthly service cost. Though, large additions such as new pages, complete revisions or complex features may require additional payment, depending on the scope.</p>

  <h2>6A. Portfolio Use</h2>
<p>I reserve the right to display and link to the websites I design and develop in my portfolio, including on my website and other marketing materials, unless you specifically request otherwise in writing.</p>


  <h2>7. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>Some websites I build may include third-party integrations such as embedded forms or analytics tools. I am not responsible for the terms, privacy, or reliability of these third-party services.</p>

  <h2>8. Termination of Services</h2>
  <p>I reserve the right to terminate any service if:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>You engage in abusive or inappropriate behaviour (with 24 hours' notice).</li>
    <li>A payment is more than 30 days overdue and no agreement has been reached.</li>
    <li>You breach these Terms in any way.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>If services are terminated, hosting, email, and domain management may be suspended or cancelled at my discretion.</p>

  <h2>9. Limitation of Liability</h2>
  <p>I am not liable for any indirect or consequential damages, including loss of data, income, or business, arising from the use or failure of my services. I do my best to provide reliable and secure services but cannot guarantee uninterrupted availability or performance.</p>

  <h2>10. Governing Law</h2>
  <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of England and Wales. Any disputes will be handled in accordance with UK law.</p>

  <h2>11. Changes to These Terms</h2>
  <p>I may update these Terms at any time without prior notice. Updates will be posted on this page. By continuing to use my services after changes are published, you agree to the new Terms.</p>

  <h2>12. Contact</h2>
  <p>If you have any questions about these Terms, please contact me using the contact details on my website.</p>
